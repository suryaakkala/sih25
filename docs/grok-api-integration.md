# Grok API Integration Documentation

This document provides information on how the Grok AI API has been integrated into the education platform to enhance student support, recommendations, and counselor interventions.

## Overview

Grok AI has been integrated to provide:
1. Enhanced personalized learning recommendations for students
2. Intelligent intervention suggestions for counselors
3. Advanced student performance analysis
4. Personalized educational notifications

## Environment Setup

The Grok API requires the following environment variables to be set in your `.env` file:

```
GROK_API_KEY=your_grok_api_key_here
GROK_API_URL=https://api.grok.ai/v1
GROK_API_VERSION=2023-09-01
```

To obtain a Grok API key, visit the [Grok Developer Portal](https://developer.grok.ai) and create an account. Once you have your API key, update the `.env` file with your actual key.

## Core Components

The Grok AI integration consists of several components:

1. **Grok API Service Module**: Located at `lib/grok-api.ts`, this provides a standardized interface for interacting with the Grok API.

2. **AI Recommendations Enhancement**: Updates to `lib/ai-recommendations.ts` to use Grok for more personalized student recommendations.

3. **Counselor Interventions API**: Located at `app/api/counselor/interventions/route.ts`, this provides an endpoint for generating AI-powered intervention suggestions.

4. **Intervention Suggestions Components**: Located at `components/intervention-suggestions.tsx`, these React components allow counselors to generate and display AI intervention suggestions.

## Usage Examples

### 1. Generating Personalized Recommendations

The recommendation system automatically falls back to the original implementation if the Grok API is unavailable.

```typescript
import { generatePersonalizedRecommendations } from "@/lib/ai-recommendations";

// This will now use Grok if available, or fall back to the original algorithm
const recommendations = await generatePersonalizedRecommendations(userId);
```

### 2. Using the Grok API Service Directly

```typescript
import { grokApi } from "@/lib/grok-api";

// Generate recommendations
const recommendations = await grokApi.generateRecommendations({
  studentData,
  recommendationType: 'study',
  count: 3,
  includeDetails: true
});

// Analyze student performance
const analysis = await grokApi.analyzeStudentPerformance(
  studentId, 
  academicData
);

// Generate smart notifications
const notification = await grokApi.generateSmartNotification(
  notificationContext
);
```

### 3. Using the Intervention Suggestions Component

```tsx
import { GenerateInterventionButton, InterventionSuggestionsCard } from "@/components/intervention-suggestions";

export default function CounselorPage() {
  const [suggestions, setSuggestions] = useState([]);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <GenerateInterventionButton 
        student={selectedStudent} 
        onSuggestionsGenerated={(suggestions) => setSuggestions(suggestions)} 
      />
      
      {suggestions.length > 0 && (
        <InterventionSuggestionsCard 
          suggestions={suggestions} 
          onImplement={(suggestion) => {
            // Handle implementation
          }} 
        />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Fallback Mechanisms

The Grok integration includes built-in fallback mechanisms to ensure the application continues to function if the Grok API is unavailable:

1. **Recommendations System**: Falls back to the original rule-based recommendation system
2. **Intervention Suggestions**: Falls back to a basic rule-based suggestion generator
3. **Smart Notifications**: Falls back to the original notification system

## Error Handling

All Grok API calls are wrapped in try-catch blocks to ensure errors don't propagate to the user interface. Errors are logged to the console for debugging purposes.

## API Quotas and Rate Limiting

The Grok API may have usage limits depending on your subscription plan. The integration is designed to be efficient with API calls to minimize costs. Consider implementing additional caching mechanisms for high-traffic applications.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the Grok AI integration:

1. **Grok-powered student assessment analysis**
2. **Predictive analytics for at-risk student identification**
3. **Personalized learning path generation**
4. **Content recommendation for additional study materials**
5. **Natural language interfaces for student support**
